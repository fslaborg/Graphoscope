"Graphoscope provides a comprehensive set of measurement tools designed to analyze, quantify, and interpret the features of graphs.\n",
"These measurements offer valuable insights into the topology, connectivity, and dynamics of your networks.\n",
"Whether you are exploring social connections, optimizing communication pathways, or studying the spread of diseases, our graph measurement functionalities are here to simplify your analysis and decision-making processes.\n",

"## Creating a graph by reading a complete graph representation as one.\n",

"Step 1 is the loading of our [example graph](http://konect.cc/networks/moreno_rhesus/), sourced from [The KONECT Project](http://konect.cc) describing the grooming interactions between rhesus monkeys.\n",

"## Loops\n",
"\n",
"The loop count of a graph, also known as the number of self-loops, refers to the number of edges in the graph that connect a node to itself.\n",
"While some may consider self-loops as noise or artifacts, in other cases, they offer valuable insights into the system being modeled and form an integral part of the graph\u0027s structure.\n",
