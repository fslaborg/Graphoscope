    "The Graphoscope project aims to provide a rigorous and performant tool for Network Science.\n",
    "It is aimed at anyone who works with Graphs/Networks and does not require a strong knowledge of F# to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up a dev environment, we recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Ionide](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fsharp) plugin\n",
    "You will also need [DotNet 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library is designed primarily for use in an fsharp scripting environment using .fsx files.\n",
    "But it also works well in [notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode).\n",
    "This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ROKvmcOloo\u0026list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oUFghYOp89baYFBTGxUkC7Z\u0026index=3) has a good walk through of setting your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing a graph\n",
    "\n",
    "The library is organised by Graph type. Currently it supports Directed and Undirected graphs, and other types, such as multiplex, will be supported in future.\n",
    "\n",
    "For illustration, we will import a directed graph from The [KONECT Project](http://konect.cc/) website. This is an excellent resource with many graphs in an edge list based format which is simple\n",
    "to import and analyse using Graphoscope. We will start by importing a [graph](http://konect.cc/networks/moreno_rhesus/) describing the grooming interactions between rhesus monkeys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a monkeys.fsx and run the following code to import and print some basic measures. Further documention of DiGraph functionality is [here](reference/graphoscope-digraph.html)\n",
